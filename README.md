# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to compare the results of the stock earnings from 2017 and 2018, and also comparing the elapsed time for 2017 and 2018, and see the differences. I've attached an URL for the repositories and PNG pictures of the results.

## Results
First, let's see the results of 2017 stock volumes: we can see that every ticker's return are positive numbers except for 'TERP', which return shows of negative 7.2% earnings. Then we can see the results of 2018 stock volumes: we can see that comparing with 2017, every ticker's return are turned negative, except for two stocks: 'ENPH' which has a positive 81.9% earnings and 'RUN' which has a positive 84% earnings. 

## Summary 
1. The advantages of refactoring code is better readabilities, easier to read and understand, also the code is better structured so it is less complex because it is easier to read, it is also good for de-bugging as well. The disadvantage would be that refactoring codes would cost much more effort to write, so if something is wrong in the codes, it would be harder to fix because it would take longer to re-write the code. 
2. The Pros and Cons for applying refactoring to the original VBA codes, I'd say that the pros would be it would be it makes the process much easier, like I can label different cells with different colors depends on their numbers, right upfront I can make the data look clean and easy to understand; Meanwhile like I said earlier refactoring definitely has more challenge, there is more likely that I would make a mistake in somewhere and easier for me to get lost during the code writing process, but once I have better understanding towards VBA and refactoring then I probably will be better at it.
